Here we would try to predict houses prices by using attention like network, and we would compare 
the performance of networks with different kinds of basic blocks.

The block types would be polynomials created by multiplications 
of different embeddings, and they would vary in the degree of the 
polynomial. 

Our goal is to compare their performance and show that degree 3 achieves 
optimal performance for fixed budget.
